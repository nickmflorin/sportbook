 * A function that takes no arguments, does not perform any logic and returns void.
 *
 * This is useful in cases where we have a prop or a function parameter that is a callback or a function, and the
 * default case should be a function that can be called but does not have any effect.  It is particularly useful when
 * integrating with third-party packages that expose a method that takes multiple function positional arguments, but the
 * first positional argument cannot be provided.
 *
 * This use case can be seen in the usage of "react-hook-form"'s 'handleSubmit' function, which takes both a function
 * that is called when the validation succeeds and a function that is called when the validation fails.
