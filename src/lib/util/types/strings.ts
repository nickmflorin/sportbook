/**
 * A type that results in a string type corresponding to the original string type defined by the first generic type
 * argument {@link T} with the substring defined by the second generic type argument {@link S} removed.
 *
 * With great power comes great responsibility, and this generic type has limitations.  With template literal types in
 * TypeScript, we cannot define, for instance, a type that dictates that a given value can only be a string without
 * certain substrings present.  This can be seen if we use this type as:
 *
 *   type MyString = ExcludeSubString<string, "password">; // string
 *
 * Additionally, there is no way to avoid nasty recursions when using the template string literal inferences that this
 * type requires if it was intended to support types that can be created from removing a union of sub-strings from the
 * base string:
 *
 *   type MyString = ExcludeSubString<"logdatapassword-username.", "password" | "username">;
 *
 * That doesn't mean that this would cause recusions in the below implementation if the conditional checks weren't
 * present, it just means we would have to introduce those recursions to make that work properly.
 *
 * We can however create a type by removing a single sub-string type from a union of base string types:
 *
 *   type MyString = ExcludeSubString<
 *     "logdatapassword-username." | "otherlogdatausername",
 *     "password" | "username"
 *   >; // "logdata-" | "otherlogdata"
 *
 * If we want define a type that is derived from the exclusion of multiple sub-strings from a string literal type, we
 * just need to use this generic multiple times:
 *
 *   // "datafordays"
 *   type MyString = ExcludeSubString<ExcludeSubString<"#data-for-days", "-">, "#">;
