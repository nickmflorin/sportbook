Re: Configuring Font Awesome

Bundle Size
-----------
The size of the "@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core" package is very significant, so the manner in which FontAwesome is
configured and used in the application is optimized to reduce the size of this bundle.  The manner in which this is
done depends on whether or not FontAwesome is being configured on the server or in the client.

- Dynamic Loading & Configuration in the Client

  We usually need to configure FontAwesome on the initial page load due to the likelihood that a component on a given
  page will be rendering at least 1 icon.  As a result, when configuring FontAwesome in the client, the initial size of
  the bundle that is sent to the browser is substantially large.

  To alleviate this, we allow the configuration to be dynamically imported and asynchronously performed such that the
  initial page render can perform the import and configuration asynchronously after the initial page load.

  Because we cannot directly import from "@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core" due to its size, there are certain types
  that we would otherwise import from that package but instead have to be "stubbed" out to remove their reliances on the
  "@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core" package import.

- Global Icon Library

  When we configure FontAwesome, we need to register the Icons that we want to use in the application with the global
  library.  This allows us to dramatically reduce the bundle size because we are not including every icon from every
  "@fortawesome/free-<type>-svg-icons" package - just the ones we need.

  This is done inside of the `configure` method.

  Even though this takes a millisecond (its very quick) - it still causes issues with NextJS:
    Error: Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server.

  See: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error

  We see this error when using a specific library or application code in a component that is relying on something that
  could differ between pre-rendering and the browser - which in our case is the registration of the icons to the global
  library.

  To fix this, we can either:

  (a) Wrap the <FontAwesomeIcon /> return in the <Icon /> component in a state variable that is set inside of a
      useEffect().  This is what NextJS's documentation suggests, but in their case it is a simple variable, not a
      variable that depends on all of the props - so it cannot work in this case.

  (b) Simply use the "require" method of importing the { library } from FontAwesome, rather than import statements.  I
      do not know why this works, but it does.

  See https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/19348

NextJS CSS Loading
------------------
Since Next.js manages CSS differently than most web projects, if you just follow the plain vanilla documentation to
integrate react-fontawesome into the NextJS project we will see huge   This is because the icons are missing the
accompanying CSS that makes them behave.

In order for this to work with NextJS, we have to manually import the FontAwesome styles and then set `autoAddCss` to
false so that the FontAwesome core SVG library will not try to insert <style> elements into the <head> of the page -
NextJS blocks this automatically.

See: https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/react/use-with#getting-font-awesome-css-to-work
